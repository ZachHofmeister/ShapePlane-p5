# ShapePlane p5.js
A generative art application written, originally written in Java with Processing, now ported (in progress) to Javascript with p5.js. Generates a grid of shapes. You can find the original project ![here](https://github.com/ZachHofmeister/ShapePlane).

# Running the program
After downloading the sourcecode, open the index.html file in a browser. The p5.js library is included and is required for the project to work.
